* Lab 1

    Lab 1, The first lab is one of my favorite labs being the jumping off point to start off learning about computer programming or at least one of its many variations. This lab is very simple using a cout statement to simply say "Hello World" which doesn't seem much but everything starts somewhere. Reading for the lab I found it really interesting as a place to start off, in a way this can be looked at as an introduction to a new community to me with saying hello world.


* Lab 4

   Lab 4, part 1 is one of my other favorite labs it is one that dove in more in the use of int and doubles and expands the use of math in these labs. The int type is used for integers that are more commonly used in programming, for example calculating dates using integers, but int can't decimals. The double type allows us to use decimals since the int type can't use decimals, and this can be used like in this lab to take measurement to convert it to other measurement where some required decimals. This is also a significant lab where this is a lab where we first use h files and it goes into calling functions from other files. It was a little confusing at first but eventually coding it into the cc file, and depending on how the function was coded in the initial function.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 this is my third lab that I liked and was interested in. This lab codes into a game called hilo game where you insert a number and another person guesses the number where the algorithm will tell if it is right or wrong (also telling if the number is too high or low), letting you have 5 guesses before losing the game. The objective for this lab was for the use of if statements that were covered before but this algorithm implementation (as discussed in the lecture) of loop pattern for counting, which was used for counting down the number of guesses in the game. This lab was a fun way to have practice writing code, what I took from this is the use of a loop pattern seeing it applied to something that can be used in a real life setting.
