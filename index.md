### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, The first lab is one of my favorite labs being the jumping off point to start off learning about computer programming or at least one of its many variations. This lab is very simple but reading for the lab I found it really interesting as a place to start off at.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 part 1 is one of my other favorite labs, it is one that dove in more in the use of int and doubles and expands the use of math in these labs. This is also a significant lab where this is a lab where we first use h files and it goes into calling functions from other files.
